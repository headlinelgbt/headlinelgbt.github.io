title:  About Headline LGBT
---

<p><strong>Headline LGBT is a quick, entertaining email looking at the day's best stories from a shamelessly LGBT perspective.</strong></p>

<p>Every morning we check out 100 news sites, and from that disorder assemble the ten most intruiging, gripping, captivating items of the day. We then collect the news together and drop a sweet crumb of deliciousness into your inbox, just in time for tea.</p>

<p>Headline LGBT is curated by living, breathing humans. No algorithms, no RSS, no bots.</p>

<p>Why email? Because writing on the web is broken. The web is a mess of clickbait and shouty journalism, with details left out and readers duped and manipulated. A lot of it is trash, and it's getting worse.</p>

<p>We want to fix that. If we can convince you to subscribe, we can deliver something great to you every day. We don't need to pay for social traffic, or use clickbaity headlines. We just publish and the best news of the day lands in your inbox. And if we don't deliver value, you can unsubscribe.</p>

<p>We can't wait to hear what you think.</p>
